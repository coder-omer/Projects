--E-Commerce Project Solution



--1. Join all the tables and create a new table called combined_table. (market_fact, cust_dimen, orders_dimen, prod_dimen, shipping_dimen)





--///////////////////////


--2. Find the top 3 customers who have the maximum count of orders.





--/////////////////////////////////



--3.Create a new column at combined_table as DaysTakenForDelivery that contains the date difference of Order_Date and Ship_Date.
--Use "ALTER TABLE", "UPDATE" etc.




--////////////////////////////////////


--4. Find the customer whose order took the maximum time to get delivered.
--Use "MAX" or "TOP"




--////////////////////////////////



--5. Count the total number of unique customers in January and how many of them came back every month over the entire year in 2011
--You can use date functions and subqueries





--////////////////////////////////////////////


--6. write a query to return for each user acording to the time elapsed between the first purchasing and the third purchasing, 
--in ascending order by Customer ID
--Use "MIN" with Window Functions





--//////////////////////////////////////

--7. Write a query that returns customers who purchased both product 11 and product 14, 
--as well as the ratio of these products to the total number of products purchased by all customers.
--Use CASE Expression, CTE, CAST and/or Aggregate Functions




--/////////////////



--CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION



--1. Create a view that keeps visit logs of customers on a monthly basis. (For each log, three field is kept: Cust_id, Year, Month)
--Use such date functions. Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.



--//////////////////////////////////



  --2.Create a “view” that keeps the number of monthly visits by users. (Show separately all months from the beginning  business)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.





--//////////////////////////////////


--3. For each visit of customers, create the next month of the visit as a separate column.
--You can order the months using "DENSE_RANK" function.
--then create a new column for each month showing the next month using the order you have made above. (use "LEAD" function.)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.



--/////////////////////////////////



--4. Calculate monthly time gap between two consecutive visits by each customer.
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.







--///////////////////////////////////


--5.Categorise customers using average time gaps. Choose the most fitted labeling model for you.
--For example: 
--Labeled as “churn” if the customer hasn't made another purchase for the months since they made their first purchase.
--Labeled as “regular” if the customer has made a purchase every month.
--Etc.

--MONTH-WISE RETENTÝON RATE


--Find month-by-month customer retention rate  since the start of the business.


--1. Find the number of customers retained month-wise. (You can use time gaps)
--Use Time Gaps





--//////////////////////


--2. Calculate the month-wise retention rate.

--Basic formula: o	Month-Wise Retention Rate = 1.0 * Number of Customers Retained in The Current Month / Total Number of Customers in the Current Month

--It is easier to divide the operations into parts rather than in a single ad-hoc query. It is recommended to use View. 
--You can also use CTE or Subquery if you want.

--You should pay attention to the join type and join columns between your views or tables.
